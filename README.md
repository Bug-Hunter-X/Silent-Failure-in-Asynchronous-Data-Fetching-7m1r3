# Silent Failure in Asynchronous Data Fetching

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart asynchronous programming: improper error handling that leads to silent failures.  The `fetchData` function attempts to fetch data from a remote API.  However, it only partially handles errors, failing to provide informative feedback when issues occur.  This can make debugging difficult.

The `bug.dart` file shows the problematic code.  The `bugSolution.dart` file provides a corrected version with improved error handling.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `bug.dart`.  Observe that if the API request fails, the program might not indicate an error clearly.
3. Run `bugSolution.dart`. Note the improved error handling and informative messages.

## Solution

The key improvement is in robustly handling exceptions.  The corrected code explicitly checks the response status code and throws a more informative exception if necessary.  A `try-catch` block ensures that any exceptions during network requests are properly caught and logged, preventing silent failures.
